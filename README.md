# new-linux-hamsoft-script
Simple script to install basic ham radio apps on new debian based linux install.
That is, any linux distro based on debian, such as ubuntu, mint, etc.  And of course, debian itself.   The script uses the APT package system to install many of the common ham radio utilities, and also makes and suggests the changes needed for the user to have serial port access also.
